## Generating GLSL shaders with Mako

This is an experiment in generating GLSL vertex and fragment shaders with the [Mako][mako_url] templating language. The parser is written in Python and it generates static GLSL code. 

### Preprocessor flags
The generated shaders contain both vertex shader and fragment shader code, and the end user program can choose which one to compile by defining the respective `vertexcompile` or `fragmentcompile` flags.
